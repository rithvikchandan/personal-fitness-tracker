# **Personal Fitness Tracker Web App**

## 🎯 **Overview**
The **Personal Fitness Tracker** is an interactive web application that helps users predict the number of kilocalories they burn during exercise based on key parameters such as age, gender, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The app leverages machine learning to provide accurate predictions and insightful comparisons with other users.

### **Key Features:**
- **💪 User Input**: Enter your personal parameters such as age, gender, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
- **🔥 Calories Prediction**: Get the estimated calories burned based on your input.
- **🔎 Similar Results**: View a sample of users who share similar calorie expenditure.
- **📊 Insights**: Learn how your input compares to others regarding age, heart rate, body temperature, etc.

---

## 🛠️ **Libraries Used**
This app leverages several powerful Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and web development:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface and handling user interactions.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization (though not directly used in this version).
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **RandomForestRegressor**: The model used for predicting calories burned.

## 📥 **Installation**

Follow these simple steps to set up the app locally on your machine.

### 1. Install the required libraries:

Ensure you have Python installed, and then run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install all necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Clone the repository and run the app:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rithvikchandan/personal-fitness-tracker.git
```

Navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located:

```bash
cd personal-fitness-tracker
```

Then, start the app by running:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **User Input**: 
   - The app prompts users to input parameters like age, gender, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature through interactive sliders.
   
2. **Data Processing**: 
   - The app loads data from the `exercise.csv` and `calories.csv` files, processes it, and prepares the dataset for training.
   
3. **Model Training**: 
   - A **RandomForestRegressor** model is trained using the historical data to predict the calories burned based on the user’s input.

4. **Prediction**: 
   - The app calculates the predicted calories burned and displays it on the screen for the user.

5. **Similar Results**: 
   - The app finds and shows other users in the dataset with similar predicted calorie expenditure.
   
6. **Insights**: 
   - The app compares the user's input against the general dataset and gives insights, such as how their exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature compare to others.

## 📊 **Dataset Information**

The app uses the following datasets:

- **`exercise.csv`**: Contains user details such as age, heart rate, exercise duration, and more.
- **`calories.csv`**: Contains the calories burned by users during various exercises.

Both datasets are merged for model training, and BMI is calculated based on the user’s height and weight.

## ⚠️ **Important Note**
For the app to work seamlessly, ensure that the `exercise.csv` and `calories.csv` files are located in the same directory as `app.py`.

## 🎨 **App Preview**
Here's how the app looks when you run it:

1. **Interactive Sliders**: Select your parameters using the intuitive sliders.
2. **Calories Prediction**: See the predicted calories burned based on your inputs.
3. **Similar User Data**: Get a sample of users who share similar calorie expenditure.
4. **Comparison Insights**: Understand how your values compare to the dataset.
